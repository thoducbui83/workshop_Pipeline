#### Connect to EC2 Public and Private Instances

In this section, we will connect to both **public** and **private EC2 instances** using **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager**, without opening SSH port 22.

We will demonstrate how to:
- Connect to a **public instance** using SSM.
- Connect to a **private instance** within a VPC using **VPC Interface Endpoint**.

This approach improves security by avoiding SSH and limiting internet exposure.

ðŸ§­ **Steps Overview:**
- The **public instance** requires an IAM role and outbound access on port 443 to communicate with Session Manager.
- The **private instance** connects through a **VPC endpoint for Systems Manager**, eliminating the need for outbound internet access.
