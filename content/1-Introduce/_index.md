**Serverless Data Processing Pipeline with AWS Step Functions and EventBridge** In the modern data-driven era, building scalable, flexible, and efficient data processing systems is essential. The Serverless Data Processing Pipeline architecture using AWS Step Functions and Amazon EventBridge enables orchestration of complex workflows without the need to manage any infrastructure. This event-driven approach ensures automation, modularity, and high reliability, while minimizing operational overhead.

By using Serverless Data Processing Pipeline with AWS Step Functions and EventBridge, you get the following advantages that traditional methods do not have:

- Automated and traceable workflow orchestration with visual control via Step Functions.

- Cost efficiency by using serverless architectureâ€”pay only for what you use.

- High scalability, ideal for large-scale or real-time data processing.

- Improved reliability through built-in retry, error handling, and state tracking.

- Seamless integration with AWS services such as Lambda, S3, SNS, SQS, and DynamoDB.
  
With these advantages, you can use a Serverless Data Processing Pipeline with AWS Step Functions and EventBridge instead of traditional solutions that require managing infrastructure such as Bastion Hosts. The serverless architecture eliminates the need for operating intermediary servers, helping reduce costs, simplify security management, and save time in deploying and managing data processing workflows.
