#### Create S3 Bucket for Serverless Data Ingestion Pipeline

In this step, we will create an **Amazon S3 bucket** to receive incoming data files. This bucket is the starting point of our **serverless event-driven pipeline**. When a file is uploaded, it will trigger an event in **Amazon EventBridge**, which then invokes a **Lambda function** to process the data.

### âœ… Result

- You have successfully created a bucket that acts as the **input source** for your serverless pipeline.
- Any file uploaded to this bucket will **generate an S3 Event**.
- In the next steps, we will configure **EventBridge Rules** to listen to S3 events and trigger **AWS Lambda** for data processing.
