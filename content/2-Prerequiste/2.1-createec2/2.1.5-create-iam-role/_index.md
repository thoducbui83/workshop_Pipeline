#### Create IAM Role for Lambda and Services Integration

In a serverless data ingestion and processing pipeline, services such as Amazon S3, Lambda, and EventBridge need appropriate permissions to **access resources, send/receive events, and process data**. This step walks you through creating an IAM Role that allows Lambda to interact securely with other AWS services.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Access IAM Console

1. Go to the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the left sidebar, select **Roles**.
3. Click **Create role**.

---

### üì• Step 2: Select Trusted Entity Type

1. On the **Select trusted entity type** page:
   + Choose **AWS service**.
   + Choose **Lambda** (or the service you want to assign this role to).
   + Click **Next**.

---

### üîê Step 3: Attach Permissions Policies

1. Search and attach the following AWS managed policies:
   + `AmazonS3FullAccess`
   + `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
   + `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`
   + `AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess`

> üí° In a real-world deployment, it's recommended to use custom policies with least-privilege access specific to your resources.

2. Click **Next**.

---

### üìù Step 4: Name and Describe the IAM Role

1. Under **Role name**, enter: `lambda-pipeline-role`
2. Description: `Role that allows Lambda to access S3, SNS, EventBridge, and CloudWatch`
3. Click **Create role** to finish.

   + Retrieve files from S3
   + Publish events to SNS
   + Write logs to CloudWatch
   + React to rules from EventBridge
