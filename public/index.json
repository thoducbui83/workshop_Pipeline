	"content": "Serverless Data Processing Pipeline with AWS Step Functions and EventBridge In the modern data-driven era, building scalable, flexible, and efficient data processing systems is essential. The Serverless Data Processing Pipeline architecture using AWS Step Functions and Amazon EventBridge enables orchestration of complex workflows without the need to manage any infrastructure. This event-driven approach ensures automation, modularity, and high reliability, while minimizing operational overhead.\nBy using Serverless Data Processing Pipeline with AWS Step Functions and EventBridge, you get the following advantages that traditional methods do not have:\nAutomated and traceable workflow orchestration with visual control via Step Functions.\nCost efficiency by using serverless architecture‚Äîpay only for what you use.\nHigh scalability, ideal for large-scale or real-time data processing.\nImproved reliability through built-in retry, error handling, and state tracking.\nSeamless integration with AWS services such as Lambda, S3, SNS, SQS, and DynamoDB.\nWith these advantages, you can use a Serverless Data Processing Pipeline with AWS Step Functions and EventBridge instead of traditional solutions that require managing infrastructure such as Bastion Hosts. The serverless architecture eliminates the need for operating intermediary servers, helping reduce costs, simplify security management, and save time in deploying and managing data processing workflows.\n"
